                    <p>I was born in Addis Ababa and raised in Hawassa.My parents have done as good a job anyone can do
                        to
                        raise a kid. I feel proud and honored that I have the privilege to call the my parents.I have
                        had
                        all the things a child dreams of in my childhood. With discipline too.</p>

                    <p>I have not begun my academic as would many peoplke call "a genius". I was just a kid who wanted
                        to be
                        something more and somehow better than what I eas. I got my wish granted. I believe I had quite
                        atremendous success for a kid who started as in place I was. When I look back to see the things
                        I
                        have accomplished, I feel statisfied even by the thought of it.</p>

                    <p>I firmly believe that I have been bestowed upon quite a lot of gift. From the academics to a an
                        environment I can flourish in, I think I have innumerable gifts that I have not even scratched
                        the
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>I have also some hobbies which are entertaining and instructive. I love Photography. I am also

                        of Sports such as Football, Basketball and track and field athletics.I also watch documentaries
